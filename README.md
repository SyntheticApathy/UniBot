This is code for the Computational Thinking project.
It is a Chat bot based on a university system.

The GUI is based on tkinker, if you want to run the code make sure you have both tkinker and pysimplegui installed and added to your python virtual enviornemnt.

to do so, if you're on mac, run

pip3 install PySimpleGUI
and
pip3 install tk

After that, make sure that when running the code you have both tk and PySimpleGUI in your build path.
This should let the code run without problem.
